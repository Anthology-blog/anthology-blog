This recipe for No-Knead Bread is courtesy of Jim Lahey of New York
City's Sullivan Street Bakery and the New York Times.


### Ingredients

Makes one 1 &frac12;-pound loaf.

-   3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, plus more for work surface
-   &frac14; teaspoon instant yeast
-   1 &frac14; teaspoons salt
-   Olive oil, as needed
-   Cornmeal or wheat bran, as needed (optional)

### Directions

1.  In a large bowl, combine flour, yeast, and salt. Add 1 &frac12;
    cups water and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky.
    Coat a second large bowl with olive oil. Transfer dough to oiled
    bowl and cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12
    hours, but preferably up to 18, in a room about 70 degrees
    in temperature. When surface is dotted with bubbles, dough
    is ready.
2.  Lightly flour work surface. Place dough on work surface and
    sprinkle with more flour. Fold the dough over on itself once
    or twice. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest about
    15 minutes.
3.  Sprinkle just enough flour over work surface and your fingers
    to keep dough from sticking; quickly and gently shape dough into
    a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour,
    cornmeal, or wheat bran; place dough seam side down on towel and
    dust with more flour, cornmeal, or wheat bran. Cover with a second
    cotton towel and let rise until it has more than doubled in size and
    does not readily spring back when poked with a finger, about
    2 hours.
4.  After about 1 &frac12; hours, preheat oven to 500 degrees. Place a
    6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot, such as cast-iron or Pyrex, in oven
    as it heats. When dough has fully risen, carefully remove pot
    from oven. Remove top towel from dough and slide your hand under the
    bottom towel; turn dough over into pot, seam side up. Shake pan once
    or twice if dough looks unevenly distributed; it will straighten out
    as it bakes. Cover, and bake 30 minutes. Uncover, and continue
    baking until browned, 15 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
