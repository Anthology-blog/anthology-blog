### Ingredients

* 2½ T shortening (butter doesn't work well)
* 2 T sugar
* 1 t salt
* 3/4 c milk (dairy or whatever)
* 2 eggs (2 large eggs would add up to ¼ cup)
* 3 1/3 c bread flour
* at least ½ t yeast


### Preparation

1. Consider if you need a loaf of bread, at least in the next 4 fours
2. Combine the ingredients in order
3. Dial in the breadmaker[^fn-Manual]
4. If things look too sloppy, toss in more flour or oatmeal. At my altitude, it's more likely too dry. Adjust with a little water until you observe a compact, tacky ball.
